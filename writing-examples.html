        <h3>Sample 1</h3>
        <p>Death, deceit, and unhappiness are three things that would not typically be associated with precious gems. Society uses diamonds to express love and devotion. Emeralds also represent successful love. Pearls are known for their calming effects, and they also symbolize purity, generosity, integrity, and loyalty to its wearer. “The Jewelry” by Guy De Maupassant represents death, deceit, and unhappiness not the characteristics of society gems. According to author Lezaed, “Maupassant was more famous for his stories than his novels, but he could pace a narrative of either length superbly, and if this at times feels more like a long-drawn-out story than a novel, that is because of its limited cast of characters” (Lezaed).The author of “The Jewelry” uses symbolism to show betrayal, irony to show to how the unknown sometimes reveals happiness, and the theme is that things do not always appear as they seem or looks can be deceiving.</p>

       <h3>Sample 2</h3>
       <p>When I was fifteen, I had a happy life in my hometown in India. My mother came to my
room one night and told me we were moving to Arkansas. I was excited but did not know how I
could be myself in another culture and in an entirely different place.
 First, my family had to drive seven hours from our home in Gujarat to the huge city
Mumbai. There we applied for a visa from an American Embassy. This was when I realized that
this move to Arkansas was really going to happen. Then we drove home and started to pack our
things for the big trip to America. We had one month to pack everything. We had to sell all our
big things that we could not bring with us. We had to say good bye to all our friends and family
there. There were several farewell parties that made me both happy and sad. My friends gave me
some awesome gifts such as a photo frame, mugs and great memories picture, so I could bring
something of them to my new world. It would probably be a very long time before I saw my best
friends again, so I was both sad and excited. On the day we left my uncle drove us to the airport
in Mumbai.</p>
